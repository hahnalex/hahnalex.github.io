- project: What's Hot and What's Not...
  role: Alexander Hahn, Dr. Somya Mohanty, Dr. Prashanti Manda
  duration: 2017
  url: "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59575-7_25"
  description: In this research project, we conducted keyword and topic model-based analysis on Bioinformatics literature. We identified top keywords- and topics-per-year and explored their temporal popularity trends. Finally, we used network analysis to identify clusters of sub-areas/topics in Bioinformatics.
